# CSCI 101 Module 8: Final Project
This program:
- Reads data from a copy and pasted data table of symbols and coordinates
- Finds maximum values in the table and forms a 2d array based on those maxmimums
- Reformats the data to fill the 2d array
- Prints the 2d array to the terminal, creating text in the form of ascii art
